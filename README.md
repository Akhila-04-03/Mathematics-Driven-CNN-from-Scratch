# Building a Custom CNN from Scratch for MNIST Classification: A Mathematical Exploration Without High-Level Libraries

This project entails designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) entirely from scratch, using only Python and no high-level deep learning libraries. Focusing on the mathematical principles behind CNNs, this work delves into the foundational operations—convolution, pooling, activation functions, and backpropagation—while constructing each component by hand. The project rigorously explores gradient descent, weight optimization, and the calculations underlying image classification. Through this hands-on approach, it provides a comprehensive understanding of CNN architectures and the theoretical underpinnings that drive their performance on the MNIST dataset
